# PCB-fault-detection-using-OpenCV-python-
This is to find the faults in PCB using OpenCV

## This project is used to detect the faults in PCB(Printed Circuit Board) using OpenCV.

### This project was done by me at Curvelogics Advanced Technology Solutions ( http://www.curvelogics.com/) as an Intern , after my training at Data Science Academy (https://datascience.one). Thanks to Mr.Brijesh Sir for his continuous support and Mr.Vishnu who helped and supported me throughthout the project. 

## INSTRUCTIONS:
  ### 1.Collect the images
  ### 2. Read the images in Python using OpenCV
  ### 3. Run ipynb file 
  
## COMPONENTS:
  ### 1. pcb_fault.ipynb
  ### This is the main program of the project.
  ### 2. requirements.txt
  ### This contains the details necessary packages to run the project.
  
## PACKAGES:
  ### 1. OpenCV-python==4.1.1.26
  ### This Package is used to manipulate Images and Videos in Python.
  
## NOTES:
  ### 1. The Original image and "Testing Image" should be of same size and format.
